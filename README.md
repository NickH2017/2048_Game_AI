# 2048 Game AI
The 2048 Game with an Expectimax AI algorithm

## Introduction

For the final project we decided to recreate the popular computer game 4x4grid puzzle "2048" by implementing an expectimax algorithm ai to play it. 

### How is it play?

The game start with an 4x4 grid with two random key assign to a value between 2 or 4. The player must combine key tiles that are of the same values until the value 2048 has reach in the grid. To combine tiles the player much choose four action to move the grid. Those four action are up, down, left and right. Each action the player chooses will move all grid value that are not the "0" key tile to the designated direction by the player. The tile will move until it has reach the boundary of the grid or reach alongside a different value tile that is not zero. After the action is perform a random "0" tile on the grid would change from either a "2" or "4" tile.

Example:

### Set up instruction: 

In order to play this game you must have python 3.9 or 3.8 intall in your computer. Furthermore, you must also have pygame already set up and install in your computer.

### Goal
The main objective for this project was to implement an expectimax AI algorithm for the "2049"
puzzle to visualize how it solve
